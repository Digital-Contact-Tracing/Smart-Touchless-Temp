# 1. Idea Category:
Medical Technology 

# 2. Idea Name (25 characters no spaces):
SmartTouchlessTemp

# 3. Idea Description:
Problem: Not able to track temperatures of people without physical contact or human intervention, being able to track that information digitally and making it auditable, follow new roll back gov guidelines without interrupting normal work

# Solution: 
An IoT device that allows users to walk up, without touching the device, and have their temp taken and recorded. Temperature on the device is taken through an IR based temp detection system. Device feeds information, encrypted per registered device user, to our cloud hosted API with a management website for auditing and data analysis.

# 4. Needed Skills or Team Members: 
IR knowledge, database architects, data privacy, encryption, automation, programmers, artists, designers

# Additional Information
This idea will be pitched at the USA West Startup Weekend. [More information can be found here](https://covid.startupweekend.org/).
